# brew-thing

Brew-thing is a recipe generator based on a person's "feeling" about the beer instead of any specifics like style or hop choice. The system will follow the general algorithm of: 

1. Get user input from sliders 
2. Determine style and ingredients from input
3. Calculate proportions of ingredients to meet user's contraints on color, ibu, abv, honesty, etc.
